# odin-recipes

This project is a recipe website. Here I will use all the html skills
I gathered through the Odin Project. 
I know a littl ebit of formatting and how to add links and pictures. 
I know nothing about styling, so I don't expect much from this website from
the looks department. But this should be fun.
